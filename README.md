# Multireference alignment using Semidefinite Programming

This repository contains reference code used for [BCSZ2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.5256.pdf).
It includes implementations for a few approaches to the multireference alignment
problem, including based on SDPs.

It was last run with MATLAB 7.11 and [CVX 1.21](http://cvxr.com/cvx/), both from 2011.

The main entry points are the `ShiftRecoveryMain*.m` files. I apologize in advance that
the code contains multiple versions with some experimental code, and may be relatively
messy.
